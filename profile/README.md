## Project Description

The Cholesterol Tracker mobile app is designed to help users monitor and manage their cholesterol levels effectively. It leverages machine learning technology to predict cholesterol levels from iris images, providing users with a convenient and non-invasive method for monitoring their health.

### Key Features

1. **ChoTrack**: This killer feature allows users to capture iris images using their smartphone's camera. The machine learning model analyzes the iris image and provides an estimate of the user's cholesterol level. Users can track their cholesterol levels over time and gain insights into their health.

2. **Findkes**: The main feature enables users to find nearby health facilities, such as clinics or hospitals, based on their current location. This feature helps users access medical assistance and consultation if needed.

3. **ChoBot**: Users can interact with a chatbot powered by the machine learning model. They can ask questions about cholesterol, receive personalized recommendations, and get general information about maintaining healthy cholesterol levels.

4. **ChoCons**: This premium feature allows users to schedule and have virtual consultations with healthcare professionals, such as doctors or nutritionists. Users can seek expert advice, discuss their cholesterol-related concerns, and receive personalized guidance.

5. **Articles**: The app provides a collection of articles related to cholesterol, diet tips, exercise routines, and overall heart health. Users can access informative articles to educate themselves about maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

6. **History**: Users can view their past cholesterol level records and track their progress over time. The app visualizes the data to help users understand patterns and make informed decisions regarding their health.
